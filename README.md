# Library-management-
📚 Library Management System (C++)

A console-based library management application built in C++ that demonstrates object-oriented programming, file handling, and modular design. The system manages students, books, and journals, while also automating fine calculation for overdue returns.

🚀 Features

Manage student records, books (ISBN), and journals (ISSN)

Calculate fines using a date-difference algorithm

Supports International and National journals/books

File handling with fstream for persistent storage

Modularized design with a separate fine.cpp for fine calculation logic

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: C++

Concepts: OOP (inheritance, virtual classes, friend classes), modular programming

File Handling: C++ fstream for data persistence
